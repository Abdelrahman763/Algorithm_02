This repository contains my solutions, notes, and practice exercises from the Algorithm 02 course by Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud.
The course focuses on improving problem-solving skills using C++, covering advanced algorithms and techniques through hands-on coding challenges.

 Topics Covered

Recursion and Backtracking

Sorting and Searching Algorithms

Mathematical and Number Theory Problems

Prime Numbers and Factorization

Combinatorics and Probability

Practice with Problem-Solving Patterns

 Goal

The purpose of this repo is to track my learning progress, organize solutions, and share implementations that may help others studying algorithms.
